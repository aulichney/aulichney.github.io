I am a PhD Student in Statistics at UC Berkeley advised by [Michael I. Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/). My research focuses on developing responsible and reliable learning and decision-making algorithms by integrating tools from statistics and computer science.  

I am grateful to have my work supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Previously, I worked in software engineering after receiving a B.S. from Yale University, where I majored in Applied Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering.
